# 2480 Team Iron Paws Friendly Manual

Hello! Welcome to the Team Iron Paws Friendly Manual. Here's a great tip, always read the Friendly manual! For new members this manual is designed to help you get started with FRC and learn the basics of how our team operates. Try not to be overwhelmed, some of the manual might be written strictly as reference for the rest of the team. Team seniors or mentors will lead newcomers through everything you need to know as well.

## External Resources
The team will update [[Resources]] with important links for team members to access. Team resources are also saved to the team website! Make sure you bookmark [The team website](https://team2480.org/) to save important information like the team calendar. For additional resources check the #resources channel in discord.

## Registration
Creating a system for registration hasn't happened yet :( But that's ok! We will update this section when a system is in place. The only prerequisite is to be a student at Roosevelt High or Hiawatha collegiate school. Please reach out to someone on the team or the team email if you want to join.
TODO: add a system to recruit mentors?
